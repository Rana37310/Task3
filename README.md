# Task 3

## Instructions
To run the code, execute the `main` class.

## Task Description
### Find Max and Min in Array
You are given an array of integers. Write a PHP function that finds the maximum and minimum values in the array. Explain the time complexity of your solution.

### Answer:
The time complexity differs depending on the search method used on the array.
- For finding the minimum value, I used iteration, which has a time complexity of O(n).
- For finding the maximum value, I used a max-heap, which has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case.

It is clear that the max-heap search has better efficiency than the iterative approach for this specific task.
